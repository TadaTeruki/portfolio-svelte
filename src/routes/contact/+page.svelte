                I'm active on X. Please feel free to send me direct messages instead
                of emails if you want to contact me casually. The response can be
                faster than email.<br />

                Note that my posts are mostly in Japanese and not related to my
                work. I only use X for communicating with friends and sharing my
                nonsence thoughts.<br />
